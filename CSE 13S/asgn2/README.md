Assignment 2: This lab uses the math.h library to compute functions (specifically: sine, cosine, tangent, and exponent) 
and compares them to my own functions that compute the same functions using Horner Normal Form and the Maclaurin Series
Equation.

Files:
math.c: Contains Sin, Cos, Tan, and Exp Functions that are called in main to compare the results between the math.h library
functions and my own functions.

Makefile: Compiles program and makes executable

DESIGN.pdf: Contains pseudocode, pre-lab answers, and a flow diagram of how I wanted to execute my program

WRITEUP.pdf: Has an explanation of my results and the conclusions I've made based on these results.
